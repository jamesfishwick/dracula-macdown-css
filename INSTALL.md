# Dracula for [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) Preview CSS

## Install

1. Download the [`Dracula.css`](./Dracula.css) file
2. Open Finder and navigate to `~/Library/Application Support/MacDown/Styles/`
   - You can also access this via MacDown: **MacDown → Preferences → Rendering → Reveal in Finder**
3. Copy `Dracula.css` into the `Styles` folder
4. Restart MacDown
5. Go to **MacDown → Preferences → Rendering** and select **Dracula** from the CSS dropdown

## What This Theme Does

This CSS theme styles the **preview pane** in MacDown - the rendered markdown output you see on the right side of the window.

For the **editor pane** (syntax highlighting on the left), use the official [Dracula for MacDown](https://draculatheme.com/macdown) theme.

## Recommended Setup

For the full Dracula experience in MacDown, install both:

1. **Editor theme** (`.style` file) from [draculatheme.com/macdown](https://draculatheme.com/macdown)
2. **Preview CSS** (`.css` file) from this repository

This ensures both your editing and preview panes match the Dracula color scheme.
